    <b>What is MatchLog?</b><br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;MatchLog is a website where you can log point information during a tennis match and view that information
     as statistics.<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Coaches can use this information to pinpoint players' strengths and weaknesses and track improvement over time.<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Data is stored in the cloud so you can access your data anytime from any device.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Create an Account</b><br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing you'll need to do to start using MatchLog is create an account.  Since all data
    is stored in the cloud, we need to know which data is yours. MatchLog accounts are simple, just an
    email address and a password.<br/><br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;To create an account tap the person icon on the main screen.<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Then, on the Sign In form:<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Enter an email address and password<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Check the <b>Create new account</b> box<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Enter the same password again<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Finally, tap the check icon.<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Thats it!
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Getting Help</b><br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, if at any time you are unsure of what to do just tap the tennis ball in the upper 
    left corner of the screen and a help panel will be displayed that has information relevant to the current activity.<br/><br/>
      <b>Getting Ready to Log</b><br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;To start logging a match:<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Tap the edit icon on the main screen<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Every match log starts out with the <b>SETUP</b> (Log Setup) tab where you enter some identifying information about the match.<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;This includes:<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Date and Time</b><br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tournament</b> (<small>eg. Southwest Summer Open</small>)<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Location</b> (<small>eg. Rolling Hills Tennis Center</small>)<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Event</b> (<small>eg. Girls 18 Singles</small>)<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Round</b> (<small>eg. Round 2</small>)<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Match Format</b> (<small>eg. 2 sets + Tiebreak</small>)<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Scoring Method</b> (<small>Ad or NoAd</small>)<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Player</b> (<small>eg. Mary Smith</small>)<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Opponent</b> (<small>eg. Kelly Jones</small>)<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>First to Serve</b> (<small>eg. Kelly Jones</small>)<br/><br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Choices for <b>Player</b>(or Opponent), <b>Tournament</b>, <b>Location</b> and <b>Event</b> are maintained by you in separate lists using the <b>List Management</b> menu.  Each function in List Management has its own help panel. Items for each of these lists can also be added on the <b>SETUP</b> tab.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Choices for <b>Round</b>, <b>Match Format</b> and <b>Scoring Method</b> are made from preset lists. 
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Logging the Points</b><br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Once the <b>SETUP</b> tab is complete and submitted MatchLog switches to the <b>LOG</b> (Log Point) tab to allow you to start recording points.<br/>Detailed information on how to record point information is on the help panel for that tab.<br/><br/>
      <b>Viewing the Stats</b><br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;As you record points, the two other tabs, <b>REVIEW</b> and <b>SETUP</b>, are active.  Current statistics can be seen on the <b>REVIEW</b> tab and the match identifying information can be viewed/changed on the <b>SETUP</b> tab.<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;To access a different tab, tap its name at the top of the display.
